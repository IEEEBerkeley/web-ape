# Course Info

APE introduces advanced printed circuit board (PCB) design and layout, with a focus on more complex considerations and more nuanced experience with standard tools than the introductory Hands-On PCB Engineering (HOPE) course. It is intended for students with previous PCB design experience (preferably HOPE) and some basic experience with upper division-level circuit design. Students will utilize Altium Designer alongside supporting software and plugins to aid in design and verification of PCBs. Students interested in developing PCBs for class projects, research, or engineering student teams will benefit from this course.

### Enrolling in APE

Students who are interested in signing up for APE in Fall 2025 should fill out [THIS](https://berkie.ee/ape-fa25-apply?ref=ieee.berkeley.edu) enrollment form.

Please email us if you are a concurrent enrollment student- we prioritize matriculated UC Berkeley students. Space permitting, however, concurrent enrollment students are welcome to take APE.

The first day of class will be 9/2.

We offer APE as an in-person class. We have a single section on Tuesday in Cory 125.

### Prerequisites

At least one upper division course with a circuit design element, such as EE105, EE108, EE113A/B, EE140 (240A), EE142 (242A), EECS151 (251A), or EE194/290: Tapeout/Bringup, will provide expected knowledge. HOPE or previous PCB design experience is also highly recommended. If you have completed alternative coursework or have experience please let us know in the application form! Those unsure are welcome to email us (the class is not limited to EECS students!).


### Office Hours

For students that need extra support time, we will hold staff office hours at  Supernode (Cory 246).
